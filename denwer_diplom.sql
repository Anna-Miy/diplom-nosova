Directed by Chris Atkins, BAFTA nominated for Taking Liberties, Starsuckers exploded into the news in October  when it emerged that the team had been selling fake celebrity stories to all the British Tabloids. This became a news sensation in it\'s own right, and was followed by the darker revelation that Atkins had secretly filmed four journalists for three Sunday tabloids  trying to buy medical records. The filmmakers also stung Max Clifford, who the film shows boasting about his clients on undercover camera. When Clifford found out, he hired the infamous law firm Carter Ruck and threatened to injunct the film which would have prevented it\'s release.

We\'ll peel  back the layers of mystery and examine in detail how the Maya  calculated the exact date of doomsday. Journey back&nbsp;to the ancient city  of Chichen Itza, the hub of Maya civilization deep in the heart of  Mexico\'s Yucatan Peninsula, to uncover the truth about this prophecy.  The Maya were legendary astronomers and timekeepers--their calendar is  more accurate than our own. By tracking the stars and planets they  assigned great meaning to astronomical phenomena and made extraordinary  predictions based on them--many of which&nbsp;have come true. Could their  doomsday prophecy be one of them? In insightful interviews  archaeologists, astrologers, and historians speculate on the meaning of  the 2012 prophecy. Their answers are as intriguing as the questions.&quot; -history.com', NULL, 0, 0, NULL, '<embed style="width:580px; height:476px;" id="VideoPlayback" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" src="http://video.google.com/googleplayer.swf?docId=-2056220249702121896" allowfullscreen="true" flashvars="fs=true">'),

Israel claimed its  forces thought the ship was an Egyptian vessel and apologized to the  United States. After the attack, a Navy court of inquiry concluded  there was insufficient information to make a judgment about why Israel  attacked the ship, stopping short of assigning blame or determining  whether it was an accident. On Wednesday, a former top Navy attorney  publicly said for the first time that President Lyndon Johnson and  Defense Secretary Robert McNamara ordered the U.S. military  investigation to conclude that the Israeli attack was an accident. The  attorney, retired Captain Ward Boston, said the White House ordered  investigators to \'conclude that the attack was a case of \'mistaken  identity\' despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary.\' Boston was  the senior legal counsel to the Navy\'s 1967 review of the attack.

It\'s not &quot;He\'s Indian so he can make fun of Indian people and get away with it&quot;; he makes fun of Asian, Latino, Arab, black, and white people too, and every time he imitates an accent or takes on a persona, he always seems to portray them from the inside. It goes beyond making a political point; it just feels casually, effortlessly human. And it\'s that casual humanity that makes it very, very funny. Topics range from a fairly sophisticated parsing of race and culture to a decidedly lowbrow discussion of body hair and male enhancement, but throughout Peters\' lack of pretension and unforced decency shines through. Be warned, many of his jokes are full of sexual and scatological references, and he has a startling routine about the deaf that will put some politically correct noses out of joint. If you think this sounds offensive, then Russell Peters is not for you--but that\'s your problem, not his. Red, White and Brown has bonus material that, startlingly enough, is actually funny (his merciless teasing of an Asian man and woman in the audience will make you cringe and laugh at the same time).
